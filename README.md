Portfolio Website – React PageFlip

This is a personal portfolio website built using React and the React PageFlip library to create an interactive book-style experience. The website presents my professional profile in a visually engaging and user-friendly way.

It includes sections such as About Me, Skills, Projects, Experience, and Contact Information, allowing visitors to explore my background, technical expertise, and work seamlessly through a page-flipping interface. The goal of this project is to combine creativity with functionality while showcasing my work and personal details in a unique format.

The project focuses on modern UI design, smooth animations, and responsive behavior to ensure a great user experience across devices.
